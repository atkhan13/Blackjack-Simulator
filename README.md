# Blackjack-Simulator

This repository contains a single C++ file which codes an interactive simulation of the game BlackJack. In this simulator, a deck of cards is initially randomly shuffled and the casino draws until it hits a value larger than 16. For each round, the amount of wins of the player and the casino is recorded. If the number of wins for the casino falls below 55%, we use a cheat function to ensure the casino wins to even out the winning percentage. To do this, the algorithm goes through the shuffled deck and picks out the cards which ensure that the casino reaches 16. Once the casino is right at 16, it can only draw one more time before it can no longer draw. This is following the rules that the casino keeps drawing as long as its total is less or equal to 16. When the total is 16 we then find the card which results in the casino getting higher than the amount needed to beat the player, but also not too high that it causes the casino to bust. At the end of each round the player can choose to either play again or end the simulator.
